                        My name is Rubal Khuttan. 
                        Since I was in high school, I have had a passion to learn more about technology, computers and programming.
                        Therefore, graduated with Computer Systems Technician diploma from Cambrian College, Sudbury, ON.
                        Understanding my passion, I started independent learning to obtain my goals. <br>
